title: 'EiGLasso: Scalable Estimation of Cartesian Product of Sparse Inverse Covariance
  Matrices'
abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of jointly estimating dependencies
  across samples and dependencies across multiple features, where each set of dependencies
  is modeled as an inverse covariance matrix. In particular, we study a matrix-variate
  Gaussian distribution with the Kronecker-sum of sample-wise and feature-wise inverse
  covariances. While this Kronecker-sum model has been studied as an intuitively more
  appealing convex alternative to the Kronecker-product of two inverse covariance
  matrices, the existing methods do not scale to large datasets. We introduce a highly-efficient
  optimization method for estimating the Kronecker-sum structured inverse covariance
  matrix from matrix-variate data. In addition, we describe an alternative simpler
  approach for handling the non-identifiability of parameters than the strategies
  proposed in previous works. Using simulated and real data, we demonstrate our approach
  leads to one or two orders-of-magnitude speedup of the previous methods.
